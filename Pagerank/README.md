Requesting to manually check my submission for Pagerank. I double checked my first submission and the portions of the code that were not permitted to modify are left untouched and no modules were imported. I tried redownloading a new source code and retyped everything on my solution and still the error below occurs repeatedly. I already tried revising my code that already worked and being careful not to modify the portions that are not allowed to be modified. If the checker had done this manually they will see that the error being sent repeatedly are not applicable anymore. I have been submitting since August 2020 and the error does not apply anymore but the checker does not recognize this.

This submission would have the error below due to the limited function of the automatic checker.
"The automated checker was unable to run on your submission. This ordinarily happens when students modify portions of the code they are not permitted by the specification to modify or import disallowed modules. Ensure yours doesn't!"
